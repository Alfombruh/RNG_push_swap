<h1>RNG_PUSH_SWAP</h1>
<p> I made this little program to allow people to easily test their push_swap</p>
<p> if you want to use it compile it with "make" and execute the program with ./random "n_number"</p>
<p> It will display a list of random numbers separated by ' ' and a '\n' at the end of the string</p>
