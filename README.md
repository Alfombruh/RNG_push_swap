<h1>RNG_PUSH_SWAP</h1>
<p> I made this little program to allow people to easily test their push_swap and change values</p>
<p> I would've loved to have this when I did mine so I hope you find it usefull</p>
<p> If you want to use it compile it with "make" and execute the program with ./random "n_number"</p>
<p> It will display a list of random numbers separated by ' ' and a '\n' at the end of the string</p>
<h3>I would try addidng a 0 at the start, end and middle of the list. Also the same thing but with MAX_INT and MIN_INT. As these numbers tend to break push_swap</h3>
